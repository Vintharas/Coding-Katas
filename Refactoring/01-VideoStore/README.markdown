  # The problem: 
  
  We have a program to calculate and print a statement of a customer's charges at a video store.
  The program is told which movies a customer rented and for how long. It then calculates the charges, 
  which depend on how long the movie is rented, and identifies the type movie. There are three kinds of 
  movies: regular, children's, and new releases. In addition to calculating charges, the statement also
  computes frequent renter points, which vary depending on whether the film is a new release.
  
  And of course... new requirements come:
  
    - the customer wants a statement printed in HTML
    - the customer wants to change the system for classifying movies. These changes will affect:
        - the way renters are charged for movies and,
        - the way frequent renter points are calculated
