FizzBuzz
========

>It’s the summer of 1923. You and a few friends are on holiday in Goeteborg, Sweden. After one round of starköl in the Nobel Bar you start to feel funny. So you make fun of people around you – loudly. As you spot someone who has that distinct Einstein-haircut you tell him that "only two things are infinite, the universe and your stupidity, and I’m not sure about the former".
>
>As it turns out this man is indeed Einstein celebrating after his nobel price acceptance speech – and now he is mad at you. To settle this issue like civilized gentlemen he proposes a little drinking game called "fizz-buzz". In order to leave the table without a serious alcohol poisoning but some of your pride left you decide to do what every person would do: Cheat!
>
>>Any number divisible by three is replaced by the word *Fizz* and any divisible by five by the word *Buzz*. Numbers divisible by both become *FizzBuzz*. Start with a random number. An example output could be:
>>
>>2, fizz, 4, buzz, fizz, 7, 8, fizz, buzz, 11, fizz, 13, 14, fizzbuzz, etc...
