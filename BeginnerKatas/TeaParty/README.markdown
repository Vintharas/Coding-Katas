>You are dead – but that doesn’t mean you can’t throw a social event. In heaven you are famous for your extraordinary tea parties. This time the guest list is quite astonishing – 8 famous British people announced their visit. So don’t mess up!
>
>>Your task is to welcome your guests properly: Some are female and some were knighted by the queen. 
>>So greet them correctly – or this will be your last hosting.
>>
>>For example:
>>
>>  *  Jane Austen is a women, so say Hello Ms. Austen
>>  *  George Orwell is a man, so say Hello Mr. Orwell
>>  *  Isaac Newton was knighted, so say Hello Sir Newton
>>
>Good luck with your party!
