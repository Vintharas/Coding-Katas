## Linked Lists

### Implement a Singly Linked List

Implement a [Linked List](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list):

* Linked list nodes
* Head/Tail nodes
* Add items (front and end)
* Remove items (front, end, by value)
* Enumerate through the linked list
* Spatial and runtime complexity?
* What is a LinkedList bad/good for?

### Implement a Doubly Linked List

* How does spatial and runtime complexity differ from a Singly Linked List?
* What is the Doubly Linked List better/worse at?
